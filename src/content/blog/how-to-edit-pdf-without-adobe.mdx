## Why You Don't Need Adobe Acrobat

For years, Adobe Acrobat was the go-to solution for editing PDFs. But times have changed. Modern web browsers are incredibly powerful, and tools like Paperwork can do everything you need—right in your browser.

Here's why you might want to skip Adobe:

- **Cost**: Adobe Acrobat Pro costs $20/month or more
- **Complexity**: Most people only need basic editing features
- **Privacy**: Cloud-based Adobe tools upload your files to their servers

## What You Can Do with Free PDF Editors

Modern browser-based PDF editors offer a surprising range of features:

### Text and Annotations

Add text anywhere on your PDF, highlight important passages, and leave comments for collaborators. Most tools support multiple colors and font sizes.

### Electronic Signatures

Sign documents legally without printing. Draw your signature with a mouse or touchpad, or type it and choose a handwriting-style font.

### Form Filling

Fill out tax forms, applications, and contracts digitally. No more printing, writing by hand, and scanning.

### Merging and Splitting

Combine multiple PDFs into one document, or extract specific pages into a new file.

## Step-by-Step: Editing a PDF in Your Browser

Here's how to edit a PDF using Paperwork:

### Step 1: Upload Your File

Drag and drop your PDF onto the page, or click the upload button. Your file stays on your device—it's never uploaded to any server.

### Step 2: Make Your Edits

Use the toolbar to:
- Click anywhere to add text
- Select the signature tool to sign
- Use the highlighter for important sections
- Add shapes or drawings as needed

### Step 3: Download Your Edited PDF

Click the download button when you're done. Choose whether to flatten the document (permanently apply changes) or keep it editable.

## Privacy Matters

One of the biggest advantages of browser-based tools like Paperwork is privacy. Your documents never leave your computer. All processing happens locally in your browser using JavaScript and WebAssembly.

This is especially important for:
- Legal documents
- Financial records
- Medical information
- Business contracts

## Conclusion

You don't need expensive software to work with PDFs. Modern browser-based editors offer all the features most people need—for free, with better privacy than cloud-based alternatives.
