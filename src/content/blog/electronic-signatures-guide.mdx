## What is an Electronic Signature?

An electronic signature (or e-signature) is a digital mark that indicates agreement to a document's contents. It can be as simple as typing your name or as sophisticated as a cryptographic certificate.

## Are Electronic Signatures Legal?

Yes! In most countries, electronic signatures carry the same legal weight as handwritten signatures. Key legislation includes:

- **United States**: ESIGN Act (2000) and UETA
- **European Union**: eIDAS Regulation
- **United Kingdom**: Electronic Communications Act 2000
- **Australia**: Electronic Transactions Act 1999

### When E-Signatures May Not Be Accepted

Some documents still require wet ink signatures:
- Wills and testaments
- Court documents in some jurisdictions
- Certain real estate transactions
- Powers of attorney (varies by state)

## Types of Electronic Signatures

### Simple Electronic Signatures

The most basic form—typing your name, clicking "I agree," or drawing with a mouse. These are suitable for most everyday documents.

### Advanced Electronic Signatures

Include identity verification and tamper detection. Often used for higher-value transactions.

### Qualified Electronic Signatures

The most secure type, using digital certificates issued by trusted authorities. Equivalent to a notarized signature in the EU.

## How to Sign a PDF Online

### Using Paperwork

1. Upload your PDF document
2. Select the signature tool from the toolbar
3. Draw your signature or type it
4. Position the signature where needed
5. Download your signed document

Your signature is stored locally in your browser for future use—never on external servers.

## Best Practices for E-Signatures

### Keep Records

Always save a copy of signed documents for your records. Include timestamps when possible.

### Use Secure Tools

Choose tools that process documents locally (like Paperwork) rather than uploading to cloud servers.

### Verify Recipient Identity

For important documents, confirm you're sending to the right person before requesting signatures.

## Common Use Cases

Electronic signatures are perfect for:

- **Business contracts**: NDAs, service agreements, employment offers
- **Real estate**: Lease agreements, rental applications
- **HR documents**: Onboarding paperwork, policy acknowledgments
- **Financial**: Loan applications, account openings
- **Personal**: Permission slips, consent forms

## Conclusion

Electronic signatures save time, reduce paper waste, and are legally binding for most purposes. With free tools like Paperwork, there's no reason to print, sign, and scan documents anymore.
